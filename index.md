## Education

*2017-today* Student in [Polytech Orléans](https://www.univ-orleans.fr/polytech/), PeiP 1 (integrated preparatory class for this engineering school)

*2017* Baccalaureate, with honours (16.86 / 20)

*2017* First Certificate of English, grade B (equivalente of GCSE)

## Experience

### Personal projects

*December 2017-today* Working on another programming language inspired by Java™, [Kafe](https://github.com/Loodoor/Kafe), running on a VM. The most interesting parts are how 
to optimize the generated bytecode and how to design the interface of the virtual machine to be able to use it easily in video games.

*2017* Worked on a programming language looking like Lisp, implemented in C++ ([Hitoban](https://github.com/Loodoor/Hitoban)), I learned language parsing.

*August 2016-today* Working on a Pokémon® oriented video game project with a 3-person team, see it [there](https://loodoor.github.io/UnamedRebirth/).

*May 2015-January 2017* Managed to create a Terraria® like project ([UrWorld](https://github.com/Loodoor/UrWorld-Alpha-3.x)), even though it was very buggy, I learned a lot about game making.

### Traineeships

<-- *June 2018* A month traineeship at [Liigem](https://liigem.io) ->

*July 2016* Worked in a pharmacy as a pharmacy technician, for a month. My job was to prepare medicines for a machine to pack them into kit.

*2015* Traineeship in Polytech Orléans for a week, where I helped an electronic technician to prepare electronic circuits for practicals.

## Languages

Spanish : basic, B1 level

*2013* School trip for a week in Barcelona, where I could practise my Spanish.

English : B2 level

*July 2015* School trip to Australia. I was housed in an Australian family. 

## Key skills

I am an autodidact : I learnt video game programming by myself, also how to design and create a [programming language](https://github.com/Loodoor/Hitoban), 
how to create a [video game server](https://github.com/Loodoor/UnamedServer).

I practised over 4 different sports (basket ball, French boxing, swimming, gymnastic), and learned over 10 different programming languages because I am a very curious person. 
I like learning new ways of thinking and solving problems.

Whenever I have a new project idea, I am following it, just to see how I could implement this or that feature, behaviour or design pattern 
([my GitHub repositories](https://github.com/Loodoor/repositories) can confirm it).

As it is almost two years since I have been working on my Pokémon® oriented project, and about two years on a remake of Terraria® (first version was UrWorld, 
then Wilanda, and now UrPlanet), I think I can tell I am very invested in my projects.
