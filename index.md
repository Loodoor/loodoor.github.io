## Summary

I started to learn programming at 8 years old with HTML and CSS, and moved on a variety of languages, from C, C++, Assembly to PHP, Python, Bash. I love building things from scratch, on a keyboard or with wires and screws. Always looking to learn more and enhance my skills.

**2020-** Student in computer science at [Polytech](http://www.polytech-reseau.org/en/home/) (French engineering school)

**2018** Laureate of the [Bourse Coddity](http://bourse.coddity.com)

**2017-2019** Student in PeiP (integrated preparatory class) at [Polytech](http://www.polytech-reseau.org/en/home/) (French engineering school)

**2017** French baccalauréat, with honours (16.86 / 20)

**2017** First Certificate of English, grade B (equivalent of GCSE)

## Skills

**Programming languages** Python, C++, Chicken Scheme, PHP, Bash, JavaScript, NASM assembly

**Description languages** HTML, XML, CSS

**Tools** Git, Visual Studio (Community, Code), PyCharm, CMake, Make, Word, Excel

**Platforms** Linux, Windows

## Experience

(personnal) **March 2019-today** Working on a programming language inspired by Lisp, [Ark](https://github.com/SuperFola/Ark), running on a VM. Interesting parts are how to optimize the generated bytecode and how to design the interface of the virtual machine to be able to use it easily in video games. Techs used: *C++*, *CMake*, *bash*

**June 2019-July 2019** Technician at [IRHT](http://irht.cnrs.fr/), CNRS, France. Techs used: *REST API* (with *Symfony*), *MySQL*, *ElasticSearch*

(personnal) **September 2018-February 2019** Made a [3D game using OpenGL](https://superfola.itch.io/the-fate-of-marcus), a Minecraft clone. I learnt a lot about OpenGL and rendering technics, and voxels' world optimizations. . Techs used: *C++*, *OpenGL*, *GLSL*, *Lua*, *bash*

(personnal) **August 2018** Made a [3D rendering library on top of OpenGL 3.3](https://gitlab.com/SuperFola/Zavtrak), which I used to create a Minecraft clone. I learnt the basics of 3D rendering and inherent problems like chunk mesh optimization, transparency handling. Techs used: *C++*, *OpenGL*, *GLSL*, *bash*

**July 2018** One month traineeship at [IRHT](http://irht.cnrs.fr/), CNRS, France. Techs used: *Python*, *d3.js* (dataviz), *XSLT* (XML document transformations)

(personnal) **May 2018** Created a small [16-bits operating system](https://github.com/SuperFola/project-E) from scratch, with a custom stack-based programming language, to learn how it works under the hood. Techs used: *makefile*, *assembly* (NASM), *bash*

(personnal) **August 2016-2018** Worked on a [Pokémon® oriented video game project](https://github.com/SuperFola/Unamed-Endive) with a 3-person team ; I discovered how to organize a project of a consequent size. Techs used: *C++*, *SFML*, *Python*, *Ruby*, *CMake*, *bash*

(personnal) **May 2015-January 2017** Managed to create a [Terraria® like game](https://github.com/SuperFola/UrWorld-Alpha-3.x), even though it was a bit buggy, I learned a lot about game making. Techs used: *Python*, *pygame*, *bash*

## Languages

English: C1 level

French: native speaker
