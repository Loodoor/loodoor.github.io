## Key skills

I am an autodidact : I learnt video game programming by myself, also how to design and create a [programming language](https://github.com/Loodoor/Hitoban), how to create a [video game server](https://github.com/Loodoor/UnamedServer).

I praticed over 4 different sports (basket ball, French boxing, swimming, gymnastic), and learned over 20 different programming languages because I am a very curious person. I like learning new ways of thinking and solving problems.

Whenever I have a new project idea, I am doing it, just to see how I could implement this or that feature, behaviour or design pattern ([my GitHub repositories](https://github.com/Loodoor/repositories) can confirm it).

As it is almost two years since I have been working on my Pokémon® oriented project, I think I can define myself as a very curious person.

### Hobbies and interests

I like cooking, but not pastries, I am more interested in meats, because they required (in my opinion) attention and concentration. It is really easy to cook once you know the rules, which is what I like most : trying things, failing, and then finding the rules for a task.
