## Key skills

I am an autodidact, for example : I learnt video games programming by myself, also how to design and create a [programming language](https://github.com/Loodoor/Hitoban), how to create a [video game server](https://github.com/Loodoor/UnamedServer).

I praticed over 4 different sports (as basket ball, French boxing, natation, gymnastic), and learned over 20 different programming languages because I am a very curious person, I like learning new ways of thinking and solving problems.

Whenever I have a new project idea, I am doing it, just to see how I could have implement this or that feature / behaviour / design pattern ([my GitHub repositories](https://github.com/Loodoor/repositories) can confirm it).

Since it has been almost two years that I am currently working on my Pokémon® like project ([first commit](https://github.com/Loodoor/UnamedPy/commit/e30c3cf39ff8b5ef4b98faa1bcadaae290b62be4) of the protype I started in Python), I think I can define myself as a patient person.

### Hobbies and interests

I like cooking, but not pastries, I am more interested in meats, because it needs attention and concentration. It is really easy to cook once you know the rules, which is what I like the most : trying things, failing, and then finding the rules for a task.
