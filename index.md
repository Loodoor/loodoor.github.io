## About Me
_I'm french_
I'm an indie dev creating all sort of stuff, such as games (2D and 3D), tools, low cost 3D engine, languages ...

I'm using Python (2 and 3), Java, C / C++, Brainfuck (love this language !), and also (but not at an advanced level) : VB.NET, C#, Scheme.

Notice that I'm also a tutorial writter on [ZesteDeSavoir](http://zestedesavoir.com) !

I'm known on the Internet as Folaefolc (but you can also see Hxokunlug or Cithoran)

I love programming, so each time I've a new idea, I'm writing it done, and when I've time, I try to realise it !

So, hum yes, I switch really often my "main" projects :)

## My Projects
Currently, I've developped :
* UrWorld, a sandbox 2D game with many strange features :p
* [simple command ftp](https://github.com/Loodoor/Simple-command-line-FTP) because I was bored to have to restart FileZila each time it was glitching/bugging
* [Pysique](https://github.com/Loodoor/Pygame3D) a simple 3D engine using Pygame
* [YKar](https://github.com/Loodoor/YKar) a simple but powerfull lisp-like language
* [Simplest](https://github.com/ZLang-ZdS/PySeventh) a python-ruby-c++-vb like language
* [Janiswo](https://github.com/Loodoor/Janiswo-2) a personnal command line to do ... so many things (programmable in Python by the user) which can't be listed there !
* [Clara](https://github.com/Loodoor/Clara) an AI based on the way a city is working

And I'm developping :
* [Unamed Rebirth (Endive version)](http://github.com/Loodoor/Unamed-Endive) a Pok√©mon like ARPG dungeon crawler with some really nice features !
