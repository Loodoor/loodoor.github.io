----

I am a young autodidact programmer who could be qualified as a Jack of all trades : I went from creating video games to making robots with an Arduino, without forgetting developing my own programming language (in order to understand how it works under the hood).
My favorite languages are Python and C++, but I am a fast learner and can adapt easily to any environment with enough time.

## Education

**2017-today** Student in PeiP (integrated preparatory class) at [Polytech](http://www.polytech-reseau.org/en/home/)

**2017** French baccalauréat, with honours (16.86 / 20)

**2017** First Certificate of English, grade B (equivalent of GCSE)

## Experience

### Personal projects

**August 2018** I worked on a 3D rendering library on top of OpenGL, which I used to create my own Minecraft clone. I learnt the basics of 3D rendering and the inherent problems such as chunk mesh optimization.

**May 2018** I created a small 16-bits operating system from scratch, to learn how it works under the hood.

**December 2017-today** Working on a programming language inspired by Java™, [Kafe](https://kafe-lang.github.io), running on a VM. The most interesting parts are how to optimize the generated bytecode and how to design the interface of the virtual machine to be able to use it easily in video games.

**August 2016-today** Working on a Pokémon® oriented video game project with a 3-person team (see it [there](https://superfola.github.io/UnamedRebirth/)) ; I discovered how to organize a project of a consequent size.

**May 2015-January 2017** Managed to create a Terraria® like project ([UrWorld](https://github.com/SuperFola/UrWorld-Alpha-3.x)), even though it was very buggy, I learned a lot about game making.

### Traineeships

**July 2018** Traineeship at the [IRHT](http://irht.cnrs.fr/) (department of the French CNRS). My job was to design websites to visualize data in different ways (you can see it [here](https://github.com/SuperFola/bibale-nodes), [there](https://github.com/SuperFola/bibale-tree) and [here](https://github.com/SuperFola/bibale-facettes)). I also worked on Python scripts to import/export data from/to the database used (Elastic search) at the IRHT. Another project I was given was a website to visualize different versions of an ancient text (encoded in XML TEI) easily.

**July 2016** Worked in a pharmacy as a technician, for a month. My job was to prepare medicines for a machine to pack them into kit.

**2015** Traineeship in Polytech Orléans for a week, where I helped an electronic technician to prepare electronic circuits for practicals.

## Languages

English : B2 level

**July 2015** School trip for a month to Australia. I was housed by a local family, who helped me discovering the culture of the country.

---

Spanish : basic, B1 level

**2013** School trip for a week in Barcelona, where I have been able to practice my Spanish.

## Key skills

I am an autodidact : I learnt video game programming by myself, as well as the fundamentals of a programming language, running on a virtual machine, by making [one](https://github.com/Kafe-lang/Kafe). I also discovered the base of an operating system by making [my own](https://github.com/SuperFola/project-E).

I practised over 4 different sports (basket ball, French boxing, swimming, gymnastic), and learned over 10 different programming languages because I am a very curious person. I like learning new ways of thinking and solving problems.

Whenever I have a new project idea, I am following it, just to see how I could implement this or that feature, behaviour or design pattern ([my GitHub repositories](https://github.com/SuperFola/repositories) can confirm it).

As it is almost two years since I have been working on my Pokémon® oriented project, and about two years on a remake of Terraria® (first version was UrWorld, then Wilanda, and now UrPlanet), I think I can tell I am very invested in my projects.
